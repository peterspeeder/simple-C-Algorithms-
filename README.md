# simple-C-Algorithms-
A c file containing simple algorithms for reference if your trying to learn.


these are simply for reference if your trying to learn the C programming language. I try to be breif and explain the steps that seem to the most confusing (to me) in the Main.c file, and I add the seperate algorithms in there own folders. 

## Hope this Helps!
